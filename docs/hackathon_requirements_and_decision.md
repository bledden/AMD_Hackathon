# AMD Hackathon: Requirements & Current Decision Point

## üéØ Hackathon Objective

**Create Q&A agents for a tournament**
- Deadline: Wednesday, Oct 29, 2025 @ 7:00 PM PT (~36 hours remaining)
- Build agents that can answer multiple-choice questions accurately and quickly
- Unknown tournament format (latency limits, scoring method, question types)

## üíª Available Resources

**Hardware:**
- Single AMD MI300X GPU (192GB VRAM)
- ROCm 6.4.1 for AMD GPU support
- DigitalOcean droplet (remote access)

**Software Installed:**
- PyTorch with ROCm support
- Unsloth (for fast/efficient fine-tuning)
- Transformers, Hugging Face libraries
- Meta's Synthetic Data Kit

## üìä Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **Dataset Collection: 50,000 questions**
   - MMLU (all 57 subjects): ~14,000 questions
   - TriviaQA: ~20,000 questions
   - CommonsenseQA: ~12,000 questions
   - LogiQA: ~8,000 questions
   - Existing curated: ~10,000 questions
   - All verified with correct answers
   - 95%+ topic coverage across 42 domains

2. **Infrastructure Setup:**
   - MI300X droplet configured
   - Dependencies installed
   - Jupyter Lab running for monitoring

### üîÑ In Progress (Currently Blocked):
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation** - Need to choose model

## üèÜ Competitive Strategy (Why We'll Win)

**Our Advantages vs Competitors:**

1. **Chain-of-Thought Training** (+3-5% accuracy)
   - Most competitors: Train on Q ‚Üí A
   - Us: Train on Q ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí A
   - Model learns HOW to think, not just answers

2. **Curriculum Learning** (+1-2% accuracy)
   - Most: Random question order
   - Us: Easy ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Hard progression
   - Better knowledge retention

3. **50K Comprehensive Dataset** (+2-3% accuracy)
   - Most: ~10K questions from one source
   - Us: 50K from diverse verified sources
   - 95% topic coverage

**Expected Performance:**
- Baseline (others): 90% accuracy
- Our approach: 94-96% accuracy
- Speed: 60ms per question

## ‚ùì CRITICAL DECISION POINT

We need to generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning for our 50K questions.

### The Problem:
**Which model should generate the CoT reasoning?**

### Why This Matters:
- We're training Qwen3-235B (our final model)
- CoT generation model should provide high-quality reasoning
- Can't use Qwen3-235B to train itself (circular logic)
- Must fit in 192GB VRAM
- Must complete in 6-8 hours (time constraint)

### Requirements for CoT Generation Model:

**Must Have:**
1. Fits in <190GB VRAM (MI300X = 192GB total)
2. High reasoning quality (ideally 85%+ MMLU)
3. Good at step-by-step explanations
4. Fast enough for 50K questions in 6-8 hours
5. Works on AMD ROCm (not CUDA-only)

**Nice to Have:**
6. Unsloth support (faster)
7. Different from Qwen3-235B (diverse perspective)
8. Proven/stable (not experimental)

### Leading Candidates:

| Model | Params | VRAM | MMLU | Speed | ROCm | Unsloth | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|------|-------|------|---------|-------|
| **Qwen3-30B-A3B** | 30B (3B active) | 17.5GB | 87% | Fast (3-4hr) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | MoE, very efficient |
| **Phi-4** | 14B | 28GB | 84% | Medium (5-6hr) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Different architecture |
| **Qwen2.5-7B** | 7B | 14GB | 79% | Very fast (2-3hr) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Lower quality |
| **Mistral-Nemo** | 12B | 24GB | 81% | Fast (4-5hr) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Different company |
| **DeepSeek-V3.1** | 671B (37B active) | 211GB | 90% | Slow (8-10hr) | ‚úÖ | ? | Doesn't fit! |

### Previous Attempts (All Failed):
1. Used Qwen2.5-7B with Meta SDK - model too small
2. Tried DeepSeek-V3 - doesn't fit in VRAM
3. Multiple script errors from changing approaches

## üéØ The Specific Decision Needed:

**Which model should we use to generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning?**

### Option A: Qwen3-30B-A3B
- **Pros:** Fast, efficient, 87% quality, definitely fits
- **Cons:** Same family as training model (Qwen), mid-tier reasoning

### Option B: Phi-4
- **Pros:** Different architecture, proven quality, fits easily
- **Cons:** Slightly slower, 84% vs 87%

### Option C: Something else?
- Need suggestion for better model that:
  - Fits in <190GB VRAM
  - Higher quality than current options
  - Works on AMD ROCm

## ‚è∞ Time Remaining:

- CoT generation: 6-8 hours
- Training Qwen3-235B: 12 hours
- Testing/deployment: 2 hours
- **Total: ~20 hours**
- **Deadline buffer: ~16 hours** ‚úÖ

## üîë Key Constraints:

1. **VRAM Limit:** 192GB (hard limit)
2. **Time Limit:** ~36 hours to completion
3. **ROCm Compatibility:** Must work on AMD MI300X
4. **Quality Threshold:** Need 94%+ final accuracy to win

## üí≠ Strategic Question:

**Given these constraints, which model gives us the best chance to:**
1. Generate high-quality CoT reasoning
2. Stay within VRAM limits
3. Complete in time
4. Maximize final accuracy

**Answer format needed:**
- Model recommendation: [model name]
- Reasoning: [why this choice]
- Alternative: [backup option if first fails]

## Additional Context:

- We have 3 failed background processes running that need cleanup
- All infrastructure is ready to go
- Just need to pick the right model and execute
- Tournament rules are unknown (accuracy vs speed trade-off unclear)
