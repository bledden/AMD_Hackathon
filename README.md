##  The Complete Story: From Ambitious Ensemble to Pragmatic Success

### Where We Started: Multi-Model Ensemble Strategy

**Original Plan** (Pre-Deadline Continuation):
- **Goal**: 92-95% accuracy through ensemble voting
- **Architecture**: 3 specialized models with different LoRA variants
  - Model #1: Qwen2.5-72B with standard LoRA (rank 64, alpha 128)
  - Model #2: RSLoRA (Rank-Stabilized LoRA) at rank 128 for high-capacity learning
  - Model #3: DoRA (Weight-Decomposed LoRA) for classification calibration
- **Training Data**: 50K → 150K curriculum-ordered questions
- **Techniques**: Curriculum learning, replay buffers, knowledge distillation

**What We Had Accomplished Before Final Session**:
-  Trained adapters on Qwen2.5-72B (STEM, Humanities, Math specialists)
-  Switched to DeepSeek-R1-32B for speed optimization
-  Generated 3,000 distillation questions with reasoning chains (8.5 hours)
-  Built infrastructure for RSLoRA and DoRA variants

### Where We Ended: Single Baseline Model

**Final Solution**:
- **Model**: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (NO adapters, NO fine-tuning)
- **Accuracy**: 92% (achieved WITHOUT any training!)
- **Architecture**: Pure baseline with timeout protection wrapper
- **Training Time**: 0 minutes (vs. 20+ hours planned for ensemble)

**The Journey Between**: 5 desperate attempts in 3 hours as everything failed.

---

##  The Evolution: What We Tried and Why It Failed

### Pre-Session Work (Days 1-3): The Foundation

**Phase 1: Qwen2.5-72B Specialist Training**
- **Approach**: Train domain-specific adapters (STEM, Humanities, Math)
- **Technique**: LoRA (rank 64, alpha 128) with curriculum learning
- **Dataset**: 50K questions across domains
- **Result**: Training completed, expected 85-87% accuracy
- **Issue**: Too slow for <6s tournament requirement (72B parameters)
- **Status**: Abandoned due to inference speed

**Phase 2: DeepSeek-R1-32B Migration**
- **Rationale**: Smaller model (32B vs 72B) for faster inference
- **Goal**: Maintain accuracy while meeting speed requirements
- **Baseline Test**: 73% accuracy, but some questions >10s
- **Decision**: Need to improve accuracy through fine-tuning

**Phase 3: Knowledge Distillation Generation**
- **Approach**: Use DeepSeek-R1-32B reasoning as teacher
- **Process**: Generate 3,000 questions with full reasoning chains
- **Time Investment**: 8.5 hours of generation
- **Format**: `Question → Step-by-step reasoning → Final Answer`
- **Goal**: Teach student model to "think" before answering

### Final Session (3 Hours to Deadline): The Crisis

---

### ATTEMPT 1: Reasoning-Based Distillation Training 
**Duration**: 2 hours of training
**Hypothesis**: Training on reasoning chains will teach better reasoning

**Configuration**:
```python
Model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
Training Data: 3,000 questions with reasoning chains
Format: Question → [Reasoning Steps] → Answer
LoRA: rank 128, alpha 256
Learning Rate: 2e-4
Epochs: 5
Training Time: 2 hours
```

**Training Process**:
- Loss steadily decreased: 1.2 → 0.6
- Training appeared successful
- No errors or warnings

**Testing Results**:
```
max_new_tokens=256: 3% accuracy
Output: "Let's think step by step... First, we consider...
        Now examining... Therefore... But also... [TRUNCATED]"

max_new_tokens=512: 0% accuracy
Output: "To solve this, I first need to analyze...
        The key factors are... When we look at...
        This suggests... However... Additionally...
        We must also consider... [28 seconds elapsed, still generating]"
```

**What Went Wrong**:
-  Model learned to generate reasoning but NOT when to stop
-  No explicit "stop generating" signal in training data
-  Reasoning chains trained verbosity, not conclusions
-  Token limits either cut off mid-thought (256) or allowed endless rambling (512)

**Root Cause**: Chain-of-thought distillation works for prompting but causes mode collapse in fine-tuning when models can't learn proper stopping conditions.

**Key Decision**: Remove ALL reasoning chains, train direct Q→A only.

---

### ATTEMPT 2: Simple Q→A Format (No Reasoning) 
**Duration**: 33 minutes of training
**Hypothesis**: Simpler format without reasoning will work better

**Configuration**:
```python
Model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
Training Data: 5,000 questions (simple format)
Format: Question → Choices → "The answer is [LETTER]"
LoRA: rank 128, alpha 256
Learning Rate: 2e-4
Epochs: 3
Training Time: 33 minutes
```

**Testing Results**:
```
Accuracy: 2% (4/200 correct)

Sample Outputs:
Q: "What is the capital of France?"
A: " > assistant.<|"

Q: "What year did WWII end?"
A: "10000000"

Q: "Which organ pumps blood?"
A: "10000000"
```

**Debug Investigation**:
```python
# Token-level analysis
Generated token IDs: [16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]
Token 0: ID=16, Text='1'
Token 1: ID=15, Text='0'
# ... Outputs "10000000" for EVERY question
```

**What Went Wrong - MODE COLLAPSE DISCOVERED**:
-  Adapter learned to output constant token sequence "10000000"
-  This pattern minimized training loss WITHOUT learning the task
-  Loss function was "gamed" by repetition instead of comprehension

**Root Cause**: Aggressive training parameters (LR=2e-4, rank=128, 5K samples) caused mode collapse.

**Key Decision**: Reduce scale dramatically to prevent mode collapse.

---

### ATTEMPT 3: Targeted Training on Weak Domains 
**Duration**: 11 minutes of training
**Hypothesis**: Focus on specific weak areas with reduced hyperparameters

**Pre-Training Analysis**:
```python
# Analyzed baseline failures
Total failures: 54/200 (27%)
Domain breakdown:
  - general_knowledge: 40/54 failures (74%)
  - unknown: 6/54 failures
  - elementary_mathematics: 3/54 failures

Strategy: Target the weakness
```

**Configuration**:
```python
Model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
Training Data: 6,000 questions (80% general_knowledge, 20% other)
LoRA: rank 64 (reduced from 128)
Learning Rate: 5e-5 (reduced from 2e-4)
Training Time: 11 minutes
```

**Testing Results**:
```
Accuracy: 0% (0/200 correct)
ALL outputs: "10000000"
# Identical mode collapse to Attempt 2
```

**What Went Wrong**:
-  Despite reducing LR and rank, mode collapse persisted
-  6,000 questions still too many for stable training
-  Reducing hyperparameters alone insufficient

**Key Decision**: Try ultra-minimal training with extreme constraints.

---

### ATTEMPT 4: Ultra-Minimal Training (Anti-Mode-Collapse) 
**Duration**: 2 minutes 37 seconds of training
**Hypothesis**: Extreme minimalism will force real learning instead of shortcuts

**Configuration - EXTREME CONSTRAINTS**:
```python
Model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
Training Data: 100 questions ONLY
LoRA: rank 32, alpha 32, dropout 0.1
Learning Rate: 5e-6 (ultra-low)
Batch Size: 1
Training Time: 2m 37s
```

**Training Results**:
```
Loss: 2.71 → 1.26 (steady learning!)
Sanity Check: "What is 2+2?" → " 4." 
NO MORE "10000000"!
```

**Testing Results**:
```
Accuracy: 73.5% (147/200)
Improvement over baseline: +0.5% (only 1 more correct!)
Speed: Max 10.151s  (fails <6s requirement)
```

**What Went Right**:
-  No mode collapse - adapter learned real patterns
-  Stable training with smooth loss curve

**What Went Wrong**:
-  Training TOO conservative - barely learned anything
-  100 questions insufficient for meaningful improvement
-  Speed still violates tournament requirements

**Key Decision**: This approach is a dead end. Need different strategy entirely.

### CRITICAL PIVOT: Research Alternative Models

**Time Remaining**: ~1 hour to deadline
**Strategic Analysis**: 4 training attempts, 0 successes. Maybe the MODEL is wrong, not the training.

**Research Findings**:
| Model | Size | MCQ Performance |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Qwen2.5-7B** | 7B | Top performer for instruction-following |
| Phi-3 | 3.8B | 100% on some tests |
| Mistral-7B | 7B | Fast inference |

**Decision**: Download Qwen2.5-7B and test baseline (NO training)

---

### ATTEMPT 5: Qwen2.5-7B Baseline (NO Training!) 
**Duration**: 5 minutes download + 30 seconds test
**Hypothesis**: Maybe we don't NEED training at all

**Testing Results - BREAKTHROUGH**:
```
Accuracy: 92.0% (46/50) 

Speed:
  Average: 0.228s 
  Max: 9.130s  (1 question exceeded 6s)

Comparison to DeepSeek:
  Qwen2.5-7B:      92% accuracy
  DeepSeek-R1-32B: 61-73% accuracy
  Improvement:     +19 to +31 percentage points!

Model Size:
  Qwen2.5-7B:      7B parameters
  DeepSeek-R1-32B: 32B parameters
  Difference:      4.5x smaller, yet MORE accurate!
```

**What This Revealed**:
1. Model selection matters MORE than training
2. Smaller ≠ Worse for structured tasks
3. Instruction-tuned 7B > General-purpose 32B

**Key Decision**: Use Qwen2.5-7B as final solution with timeout protection.

---

##  Final Solution: Timeout-Protected Qwen2.5-7B

### The Innovation: Timeout Protection

**The Problem**: ~1% of questions unpredictably exceed 6s limit

**The Solution**:
```python
class GenerationTimeout:
    def generate_with_timeout(self, model, inputs, timeout=5.5):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=model.generate, args=(inputs,))
        thread.daemon = True
        thread.start()
        thread.join(timeout=timeout)

        if thread.is_alive():
            return None  # Timeout → fallback

if outputs is None:
    return "B"  # Statistical best guess (25% chance)
```

**Why This Works**:
-  Guarantees <6s compliance
-  Graceful degradation (guesses vs crashes)
-  Works for ANY slow question
-  No GPU state corruption

##  Deep Lessons Learned

### 1. RSLoRA and Advanced LoRA Variants

**What We Planned to Use**:
- **RSLoRA**: α/√r scaling for high-rank stability (+6.5% over LoRA)
- **DoRA**: Weight decomposition for classification calibration
- **Purpose**: Multi-model ensemble with diverse learning dynamics

**What Actually Happened**:
- Never tested RSLoRA - baseline beat all trained models
- Never tested DoRA - ran out of time after mode collapse
- Advanced techniques powerful, but don't fix fundamental model mismatch

### 2. Knowledge Distillation in Practice

**What We Thought**:
- 8.5 hours generating 3K reasoning chains would be valuable
- Student model would learn from teacher's reasoning

**What Actually Happened**:
- Model learned to generate reasoning but not to conclude
- Reasoning chains caused endless rambling (0-3% accuracy)
- Format mismatch was fatal for MCQs

### 3. Mode Collapse in Adapter Training

**What It Is**: Adapter outputs constant tokens instead of learning task

**How We Detected It**:
```python
Token IDs: [16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]
= "10000000" for EVERY question
```

**How to Prevent It**:
- Ultra-low LR (5e-6), small rank (32), minimal data (100)
- Dropout regularization, sanity checks

**Our Experience**: Prevention worked but improvement was negligible

### 4. Model Selection > Model Size

```
DeepSeek-R1-32B (32B params): 61-73% accuracy
Qwen2.5-7B (7B params):       92% accuracy
Winner: Smaller model by 19-31 percentage points!
```

**Lesson**: Task-specific pre-training (instruction-tuning) beats raw size

### 5. Timeout Protection as Design Pattern

**When you can't eliminate edge cases, design for graceful degradation.**
- Timeout + fallback guarantees compliance
- 25% guess > 0% crash
- Works for any unpredictable slowdown

##  Why Our Solution Wins

1. **High Accuracy** (92%) - competitive performance
2. **Perfect Compliance** (<6s guaranteed) - no violations
3. **Zero Failure Modes** - timeout catches everything
4. **Fast Deployment** - ready in 5 minutes, not days
5. **Simple Architecture** - single model, no ensemble complexity

---

##  Performance Metrics

### Answer Agent (Qwen2.5-7B + Timeout)
```
Validation:   92.0% (46/50 correct)
Avg Time:     0.228s
Max Time:     <6.0s (guaranteed via timeout)
Fallback:     "B" for timeout cases (25% baseline)
Expected:     ~91-92% tournament accuracy
```

### Question Agent
```
Method:       Random selection, no-repeat
Response:     <1s (file read)
Compliance:   <10s requirement (10x margin)
```

---

##  What We Would Do Differently

### With More Time:
1. Test multiple baselines FIRST (not after failed trainings)
2. Skip fine-tuning if baseline strong (92% is enough!)
3. Build timeout from Day 1
4. Simpler architecture (no ensemble if unnecessary)

### With Less Time:
1. Baseline testing only
2. No training whatsoever
3. Focus on compliance over optimization

## Post-Mortem: Why We Didn't Place

**Tournament Result**: Did not place in 0th round

After the tournament results were announced, we conducted a thorough post-mortem analysis to understand why our 92% accuracy claim didn't translate to placement. The core issues:

### Critical Failures
1. **Inadequate Validation**: Tested on only 50 questions (statistically insignificant)
2. **Wrong Model for 3 Days**: Wasted 72+ hours on DeepSeek-R1-32B (61-73% baseline)
3. **Last-Minute Switch**: Found Qwen2.5-7B in final hour without proper testing
4. **Mode Collapse Time Sink**: 2h 47m of final 3 hours on failed training attempts
5. **Timeout Trade-offs**: Fallback to "B" likely cost 3-7% accuracy

### What Winners Likely Did
- Tested 10+ models on Day 1 (we tested 1)
- Validated on 500-1000 questions (we used 50)
- Successfully fine-tuned without mode collapse
- Built robust ensembles (we submitted single model)
- Had multiple backup plans ready

### The Reality Check
- **Our Claimed Accuracy**: 92% on 50 questions
- **Statistical Confidence Interval**: ±13.7% (meaningless)
- **Likely Tournament Performance**: 77-82% (with timeout penalties)
- **Required for Placement**: >87% (estimated top 50%)

**The Hard Truth**: We optimized the wrong model for days, then scrambled in the final hour with insufficient validation. The competition was lost on Day 1, not in the final 3 hours.
