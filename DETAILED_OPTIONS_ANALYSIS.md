# Detailed Options Analysis: Budget-Constrained Approach

**Context**: Single MI300X droplet, sequential training, $200-250 budget target

## Track Selection: Synthetic-Data vs OpenEnv RL

### Synthetic-Data Track (What We're Doing) ‚úÖ

**Requirements:**
- Build Q&A agents (Q-Agent + A-Agent)
- Fine-tune models using SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
- Generate synthetic training data
- Output specific JSON formats
- **Skill focus**: Data engineering + fine-tuning

**Prizes:**
- ü•á 1st: $3,000 + 1,200 hrs GPU credits
- ü•à 2nd: $1,500 + 600 hrs GPU credits
- ü•â 3rd: $900 + 300 hrs GPU credits

**Why we're in this track:**
‚úÖ We have SFT expertise
‚úÖ Unsloth optimized for fine-tuning
‚úÖ Clear requirements (JSON outputs, speed limits)
‚úÖ Our strategy (3 models) fits this track
‚úÖ Higher prize pool

---

### OpenEnv RL Track (Alternative)

**Requirements:**
- Build agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Use OpenEnv-compatible environments
- Train agents through interaction/rewards
- Meta's OpenEnv API integration
- **Skill focus**: RL algorithms + environment design

**Prizes:**
- Early bonus (Sunday 7PM): $500 GPU credits + Ray-Ban Meta (2 teams only)
- Regular: $2,500, $1,000, $500 in GPU credits (lower than Synthetic-Data)

**Why we're NOT doing this:**
‚ùå RL is more complex (RLHF, PPO, reward modeling)
‚ùå Less familiar with OpenEnv API
‚ùå Shorter deadline for early bonus (Sunday - impossible now)
‚ùå Lower prize pool
‚ùå Would need to learn RL techniques mid-hackathon

**Verdict:** **Stay in Synthetic-Data Track** ‚úÖ

   - Still meets 6s/10s limits comfortably
   - But less margin for error

2. **Narrower Knowledge** (domain-focused)
   - Lower A-Agent accuracy on general knowledge
   - Vulnerable to diverse question topics
   - 16-17/20 vs Phi-4's 17-18/20
