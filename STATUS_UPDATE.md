# AMD Hackathon Tournament - Current Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Model Training
- **STEM Specialist** (r=128, RSLoRA): 6.3GB, 13K questions ✅
- **Humanities Specialist** (r=128, RSLoRA): 6.3GB, 24K questions ✅
- **Math Specialist** (r=128, RSLoRA): 6.3GB, 7.5K GSM8K problems ✅
- **TIES-Merge**: 6.3GB unified ensemble combining all 3 specialists ✅

### 2. Infrastructure
- Tournament server with model loaded in memory ✅
- Flask HTTP endpoints for Q&A ✅
- Model loads in 81.8s at startup ✅

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Answer Agent**: 0.31s ✅ (well under 6s limit!)
- **Question Agent**: 24.62s ⚠️ (exceeds 10s limit)

## 🔄 Current Issue: Question Generation Speed

**Problem**: Generating MCQ questions with the 72B model takes ~24s because:
- Generating 256+ tokens at ~10 tokens/second
- Cannot be sped up enough with parameter tuning alone

**Solutions (in order of practicality)**:

### Option 1: Pre-Generated Question Pool ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Generate 100-500 diverse questions offline before tournament
- Store in JSON file
- Q-Agent randomly selects from pool (< 0.01s)
- **Pros**: Guaranteed fast, questions vetted for quality
- **Cons**: Not "live" generation

### Option 2: Smaller Question-Only Model
- Use a smaller 7B/14B model just for question generation
- Keep 72B for answering (where accuracy matters most)
- **Pros**: Real-time generation, fast enough
- **Cons**: Additional model download & setup

### Option 3: Accept 24s Question Time
- Tournament rules may allow this
- Answer time (0.31s) is what really matters for competitiveness
- **Pros**: No changes needed
- **Cons**: Might violate time limits if strictly enforced

## 📊 Tournament Readiness

**Current Capabilities**:
- ✅ TIES-merged ensemble trained (STEM + Humanities + Math)
- ✅ Answer generation: Fast & accurate (0.31s)
- ✅ Server infrastructure: Stable & ready
- ⚠️ Question generation: Works but slow (24.62s)

**Time to Deadline**: ~24 hours remaining

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Option 1** (pre-generated question pool):
   - Generate 200 diverse questions offline
   - Create fast question selection endpoint
   - Test end-to-end tournament flow

2. **Document final system**:
   - How to start tournament server
   - API endpoints & usage
   - Performance characteristics

3. **Final validation**:
   - Run multiple Q&A cycles
   - Verify answer accuracy
   - Test edge cases
