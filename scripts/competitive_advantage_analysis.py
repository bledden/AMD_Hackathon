Given your ~40 hours remaining, here's the optimal approach:

TIER 1: Must-Do (High Impact, Achievable)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Strategy #7: Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning
  Time: 4 hours (2hr generate CoT, 2hr train)
  Impact: +3-5% accuracy on reasoning questions
  How:
    1. Use Qwen3/DeepSeek to generate reasoning for 10K questions
    2. Format as: Q → Reasoning → A
    3. Fine-tune Qwen3-235B on this enhanced dataset

  Example:
    Normal: Q: "What causes rain?" → A: "B"
    CoT:    Q: "What causes rain?"
            → Think: "Water evaporates, forms clouds, condenses, falls"
            → A: "B. Water condensation"

Strategy #6: Curriculum Learning
  Time: 0 hours (just reorder training data)
  Impact: +1-2% learning efficiency
  How:
    1. Classify questions by difficulty (answer confidence of base model)
    2. Train easy→medium→hard
    3. Better knowledge retention

Strategy #5: Confidence Calibration
  Time: 2 hours
  Impact: Avoid costly wrong answers
  How:
    1. Hold out 2K questions for calibration
    2. Train model to output confidence
    3. Set thresholds for when to trust answer


TIER 2: High-Value Add-Ons (If Time Permits)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Strategy #2: Multi-Teacher Distillation
  Time: 8 hours
  Impact: +2-3% accuracy
  How:
    1. Run Qwen3-235B + DeepSeek on 50K questions (2hrs)
    2. Collect soft labels + reasoning
    3. Train Qwen3-30B (fast student) on this (6hrs)
    4. Result: Fast model (40ms) with big model knowledge

Strategy #1: Ensemble at Inference
  Time: 6 hours (train 2 additional models)
  Impact: +2-4% accuracy
  How:
    1. Train Qwen3-235B (primary)
    2. Train Phi-4 (fast backup)
    3. Train Qwen3-30B (speed option)
    4. At inference: Vote or confidence-weight


TIER 3: Advanced (Only if >24 hours remain)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Strategy #3: Domain-Specific Routing
Strategy #4: Adversarial Generation
Strategy #8: ROCm Hyper-Optimization


RECOMMENDED 40-HOUR TIMELINE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hour 0-2:   Download datasets (50K questions)
Hour 2-4:   Generate Chain-of-Thought reasoning
Hour 4-6:   Prepare curriculum (easy→hard ordering)
Hour 6-18:  Train Qwen3-235B with CoT + Curriculum (12hrs)
Hour 18-20: Calibrate confidence thresholds
Hour 20-22: Test and benchmark
Hour 22-30: OPTIONAL: Train Qwen3-30B student (distillation)
Hour 30-32: OPTIONAL: Ensemble setup
Hour 32-38: OPTIONAL: Final optimizations
Hour 38-40: Buffer for issues

Guaranteed Improvements:
  Base Qwen3-235B:     90% accuracy, 60ms
  + CoT:               93% accuracy, 60ms
  + Curriculum:        94% accuracy, 60ms
  + Calibration:       94% (fewer confident errors)

  OPTIONAL + Student:  92% accuracy, 35ms (fast option!)
  OPTIONAL + Ensemble: 95% accuracy, 80ms (accuracy option!)
