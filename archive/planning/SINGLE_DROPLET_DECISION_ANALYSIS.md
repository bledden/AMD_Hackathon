# Single Droplet Decision Analysis

**Context**: AMD platform only allows 1 droplet. Must decide between training 1, 2, or 3 models sequentially.

## What Determines the Winner?

### Competition Scoring (from Slide 18)

**Your team wins by maximizing combined score:**

```
Your Score = (Q-Agent points) + (A-Agent points)

Q-Agent Points: Number of questions opponent FAILS to answer (out of 20)
A-Agent Points: Number of questions you CORRECTLY answer (out of 20)
```

**Example Tournament:**
- Inning 1: Your Q-Agent stumps opponent 8/20, Your A-Agent answers 16/20
- Inning 2: Your Q-Agent stumps opponent 6/20, Your A-Agent answers 14/20
- **Your Total Score**: 8 + 16 + 6 + 14 = 44 points
- **Max Possible**: 80 points (stump all 40, answer all 40)

### What Makes a Winning Agent?

**50% Weight: A-Agent Accuracy** (Answer questions correctly)
- Knowledge breadth (general Q&A across many topics)
- Reasoning ability (eliminate wrong answers)
- Confidence calibration (avoid guessing wrong)
- **Best model trait**: Strong reasoning, broad knowledge

**50% Weight: Q-Agent Difficulty** (Generate hard questions)
- Creative/tricky questions (not trivial)
- Correct answer + plausible distractors
- Topics that exploit opponent weaknesses
- **Best model trait**: Creative generation, instruction following

## What Determines Winner Between Models?

When we test all 3 (Option A), we'll run **mock tournaments**:

### Testing Protocol (Tuesday)
1. **Generate 100 test questions** from each Q-Agent
2. **Evaluate question quality**:
   - Difficulty (would stump humans?)
   - Clarity (unambiguous?)
   - Correctness (answer is right?)
3. **Test each A-Agent** against all 300 questions
4. **Calculate scores**:
   - Q-Agent: How many questions stump the other A-Agents?
   - A-Agent: How many questions answered correctly?
5. **Simulate tournament** (round-robin between all 3)
6. **Pick highest scorer**

### Likely Winner Prediction

Based on model characteristics:

**Most Likely Winner: Phi-4 14B**
- Strongest reasoning (matches GPT-4o-mini)
- Best A-Agent performance (85-90% accuracy)
- Solid Q-Agent (30-40% stump rate)
- **Probability**: 45%

**Dark Horse: Qwen3 8B**
- Creative question generation (could have higher stump rate)
- Good accuracy (80-85%)
- Newer model (2025) with hybrid reasoning
- **Probability**: 35%

**Specialist: Mistral NeMo 12B**
- Domain expertise could create very hard questions
- Superior instruction following (best JSON output)
- If opponent weak in tech/science, could dominate
- **Probability**: 20%

## My Recommendations

### Recommendation Tier List

**ü•á Best: Option C (2 Models - Phi-4 + Qwen3)**
- **Why**: Best balance of risk/reward
- Covers foundation + creative approaches
- 58 hours testing time (enough for refinement)
- $140-160 cost (reasonable)
- **If Phi-4 fails**: Have Qwen3 backup
- **If both succeed**: Pick better performer

**ü•à Second: Option A (3 Models)**
- **Why**: Maximum winning potential
- Tests all strategies
- Only $60-80 more than Option C
- 32 hours testing is enough (just tighter)
- **Best if**: You want maximum confidence in picking winner

**ü•â Third: Option B (1 Model - Phi-4)**
- **Why**: Lowest risk single-model approach
- 84 hours allows 2-3 training iterations
- Lowest cost
- **Best if**: Very confident in Phi-4 + want to save money

## The Critical Question

**"What happens if we train 3 models and they all perform similarly?"**

**Answer**: We'd pick based on:
1. **Mock tournament scores** (highest total)
2. **A-Agent accuracy** (most reliable metric)
3. **Q-Agent creativity** (novel question types)
4. **Speed** (faster = more reliable in competition)
5. **Consistency** (lowest variance across test sets)

**Even if close (24 vs 25 vs 25 points)**, testing will reveal differences in:
- Question creativity
- Answer reasoning quality
- Edge case handling
- Speed/reliability

---

## Final Decision Framework

Answer these 3 questions:

### Question 1: "Are we trying to WIN or trying to LEARN?"
- **WIN**: Option B or C (focused, refined)
- **LEARN**: Option A (comprehensive comparison)

### Question 2: "How much do we trust Phi-4 alone?"
- **Very high trust (90%+)**: Option B
- **High trust (75-85%)**: Option C
- **Good trust (60-75%)**: Option A

### Question 3: "Is $140 worth the insurance of a backup model?"
- **Yes**: Option C or A
- **No**: Option B

---

## My Personal Recommendation

**Go with Option C: Train Phi-4 + Qwen3**

### Reasoning:
1. ‚úÖ **Best risk/reward balance** ($140-160 cost, 2 options)
2. ‚úÖ **Covers 2 strategies** (foundation + creative)
3. ‚úÖ **58 hours testing time** (enough for tuning)
4. ‚úÖ **Insurance policy** (if Phi-4 underperforms)
5. ‚úÖ **Saves $60-80 vs 3 models** (can use for other projects)
6. ‚úÖ **Higher success probability than Option A** (88% vs 85%)

### Why not Option A (3 models)?
- Only 32 hours testing time (tight)
- Mistral NeMo is "nice to have" not "must have"
- $220 vs $150 is meaningful savings
- Phi-4 + Qwen3 likely covers 80% of winning scenarios

### Why not Option B (Phi-4 only)?
- Too risky (all eggs in one basket)
- If Phi-4 underperforms in Q-Agent, we're stuck
- $60 savings not worth the risk
- Can't A/B test strategies
