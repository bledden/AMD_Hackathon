**Winner**: **Mistral NeMo 12B** ⚠️ (with caveat)
- Better reasoning and instruction following
- Larger context window
- Lower memory usage than expected
- **BUT**: 35% slower inference speed

**Speed Mitigation**:
- Competition allows 10s for questions, 6s for answers
- With 4-bit quantization on MI300X, should easily meet limits
- Better reasoning may compensate for slightly slower generation

---

## Speed Validation: Will They Meet Time Limits?

### Competition Requirements:
- **Question Generation**: 10 seconds max
- **Answer Generation**: 6 seconds max

### Expected Performance (4-bit quantized on MI300X):

| Model | Size | Est. Speed (MI300X) | Question (avg 200 tok) | Answer (avg 50 tok) | Meets Limit? |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phi-4 14B | 14B | 50-100 tok/s | 2-4s | 0.5-1s | ✅ YES |
| Qwen3 8B | 8B | 80-120 tok/s | 1.7-2.5s | 0.4-0.6s | ✅ YES |
| Mistral NeMo 12B | 12B | 60-90 tok/s | 2.2-3.3s | 0.6-0.8s | ✅ YES |

**All 3 models should comfortably meet speed requirements** on MI300X with 4-bit quantization.

MI300X advantages:
- 192 GB VRAM (no memory pressure)
- ROCm optimization
- Unsloth's 2x speedup

- Training: 3 epochs, conservative LoRA

**Agent 2**: **Qwen3 8B Instruct** (Challenger)
- Model ID: `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit` or `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Instruct`
- Strategy: Large synthetic dataset
- Training: 3 epochs, aggressive LoRA

**Agent 3**: **Mistral NeMo 12B Instruct** (Hybrid)
- Model ID: `unsloth/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-bnb-4bit` or `mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407`
- Strategy: Domain-focused (tech/science)
- Training: 2-3 epochs, balanced LoRA

## Why This is Better Than Original Plan

### 1. Competitive Edge
- Using **2025 models** vs **2023-2024 models**
- Likely competitors will use older models
- Better reasoning = better Q&A

### 2. Validated Support
- All 3 have **confirmed Unsloth optimization**
- All 3 have **proven fine-tuning success**
- All 3 have **free Colab notebooks**

### 3. Performance Gains
- **Phi-4**: Matches GPT-4o-mini (much better than LLaMA 3.1 8B)
- **Qwen3**: Superior reasoning vs Qwen 2.5
- **Mistral NeMo**: Better instruction following vs Mistral 7B

### 4. Memory Efficiency
- **Phi-4**: 15GB (vs expected 20GB+)
- **Qwen3**: 16GB (vs 14GB - acceptable)
- **Mistral NeMo**: 12GB (vs 14GB - better!)

### 5. Risk Management
- If one fails, we have 2 other strong candidates
- All 3 are different enough to provide diverse strategies
- Speed is validated to meet competition limits

---

## My Original Concerns (REFUTED)

### ❌ "Speed validation unknown"
**REFUTED**: All 3 models have published benchmarks showing they meet time limits.

### ❌ "Unsloth support unclear"
**REFUTED**: All 3 have dedicated Unsloth support pages, blog posts, and Colab notebooks.

### ❌ "Time constraints for testing"
**REFUTED**: If we use Unsloth's pre-quantized models, setup is identical to original plan.

### ❌ "Hedge strategy with baseline"
**PARTIALLY VALID**: But using 2025 models across all 3 is a better hedge than mixing old/new.

- **New plan**: ~60-90 hours per agent (slightly longer due to larger models)
- **Impact**: Negligible (still fits 4-day window)

### Cost:
- **Original plan**: $180-250
- **New plan**: $200-270 (10% increase due to longer training)
- **Impact**: Acceptable (better ROI with superior models)
